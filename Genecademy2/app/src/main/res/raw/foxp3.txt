The FOXP3 gene provides instructions for producing the forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) protein. The FOXP3 protein attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of genes that are involved in regulating the immune system. On the basis of this role, the FOXP3 protein is called a transcription factor. This protein is essential for the production and normal function of certain immune cells called regulatory T cells, which play an important role in preventing autoimmunity. Autoimmunity occurs when the body attacks its own tissues and organs by mistake. The FOXP3 protein is found primarily in an immune system gland called the thymus, where regulatory T cells are produced.At least 21 mutations in the FOXP3 gene have been found to cause immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. Most mutations change one protein building block (amino acid) in the region of the FOXP3 protein that binds to DNA or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. Mutations in the FOXP3 gene result in reduced numbers or a complete absence of regulatory T cells. Without the proper number of regulatory T cells, the body cannot control immune responses. Normal body tissues and organs are attacked, causing the multiple autoimmune disorders present in people with IPEX syndrome.Genetics Home Reference provides information about type 1 diabetes.Cytogenetic Location: Xp11.23, which is the short (p) arm of the X chromosome at position 11.23Molecular Location: base pairs 49,250,436 to 49,266,505 on the X chromosome (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: March 2013Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
