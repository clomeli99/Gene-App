The SIL1 gene provides instructions for producing a protein located in a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. Among its many functions, the endoplasmic reticulum folds and modifies newly formed proteins so they have the correct 3-dimensional shape.  The SIL1 protein works with BiP, a protein that helps fold newly produced proteins into the proper shape and refold damaged proteins.  To start this process, BiP attaches (binds) to a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  When BiP folds a protein, the ATP is converted to a similar molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP).  Then the SIL1 protein releases ADP from BiP so that it can bind to another molecule of ATP and start the protein folding process again.  Because of its role in helping BiP exchange ADP for ATP, the SIL1 protein is called a nucleotide exchange factor.More than a dozen mutations in the SIL1 gene have been found to cause Marinesco-Sjgren syndrome.  Most of these mutations result in the production of a protein that has little or no activity.  Defective SIL1 protein cannot remove ADP from BiP.  BiP is then unable to bind to ATP and re-start the protein folding process.  A disruption in protein folding impairs protein transport and causes proteins to accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum.  This accumulation likely damages and destroys cells in many different tissues, leading to poor coordination, muscle weakness, and the other features of Marinesco-Sjgren syndrome.Cytogenetic Location: 5q31.2, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 31.2Molecular Location: base pairs 138,946,720 to 139,198,376 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: September 2008Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
