The SLC7A9 gene provides instructions for producing one part (subunit) of a protein made primarily in the kidneys.  This subunit joins with another protein subunit, produced from the SLC3A1 gene, to form a transporter protein complex. During the process of urine formation in the kidneys, this protein complex absorbs particular protein building blocks (amino acids) back into the blood.  In particular, the amino acids cystine, ornithine, arginine, and lysine are absorbed back into the blood through this mechanism.At least 95 mutations in the SLC7A9 gene have been found to cause cystinuria.  Many of these mutations alter a single DNA building block (nucleotide) or insert or delete a small number of nucleotides in the SLC7A9 gene. These changes lead to an abnormally functioning transporter protein complex, which causes certain amino acids to become concentrated in the urine.  Cystine is the only amino acid that forms crystals and stones in the bladder or kidneys, leading to the signs and symptoms of cystinuria.Cytogenetic Location: 19q13.11, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.11Molecular Location: base pairs 32,830,511 to 32,870,958 on chromosome 19 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: January 2009Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
