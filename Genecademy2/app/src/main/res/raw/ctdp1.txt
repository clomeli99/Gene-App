The CTDP1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1. This protein helps regulate the activity of an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. The RNA polymerase II enzyme initiates transcription, which is a key step in using the information carried by genes to direct the production (synthesis) of proteins.Thus far, everyone with CCFDN has had the same mutation in both copies of the CTDP1 gene in each cell. This mutation, written as IVS6+389CT, alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein. The altered instructions introduce a premature stop signal, resulting in an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein that cannot regulate transcription. Defective regulation of the transcription process affects the development and function of many parts of the body. It is not known how nonfunctional carboxy-terminal domain phosphatase 1 protein results in the specific signs and symptoms of CCFDN.Cytogenetic Location: 18q23, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 18 at position 23Molecular Location: base pairs 79,679,801 to 79,754,510 on chromosome 18 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: April 2010Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
