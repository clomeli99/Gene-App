The SOX2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the formation of many different tissues and organs during embryonic development. The SOX2 protein is especially important for the development of the eyes. This protein regulates the activity of other genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA. On the basis of this action, the SOX2 protein is called a transcription factor.Genetics Home Reference provides information about combined pituitary hormone deficiency.Genetics Home Reference provides information about microphthalmia.Genetics Home Reference provides information about septo-optic dysplasia.At least 33 mutations in the SOX2 gene have been found to cause SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome. Some of these mutations prevent the gene from making any SOX2 protein, while others result in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. A few mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SOX2 protein. All of these mutations disrupt the protein's ability to regulate genes essential for normal development of the eyes and other parts of the body. Abnormal development of these structures causes the signs and symptoms of SOX2 anophthalmia syndrome.Cytogenetic Location: 3q26.33, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 26.33Molecular Location: base pairs 181,711,924 to 181,714,436 on chromosome 3 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: March 2009Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
