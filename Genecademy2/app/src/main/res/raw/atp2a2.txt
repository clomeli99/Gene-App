The ATP2A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase 2 (SERCA2). This enzyme belongs to a family of ATPase enzymes that helps control the level of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) inside cells.  Within the cell, SERCA2 is found in the endoplasmic reticulum and a related structure in muscle cells called the sarcoplasmic reticulum.  The endoplasmic reticulum is a structure inside the cell that is involved in protein processing and transport.  The sarcoplasmic reticulum assists with muscle contraction and relaxation by releasing and storing calcium ions. Calcium ions act as signals for a large number of activities that are important for the normal development and function of cells.  SERCA2 allows calcium ions to pass into and out of the cell in response to cell signals.More than 130 mutations in the ATP2A2 gene have been found to cause Darier disease.  Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SERCA2 enzyme.  All mutations cause the production of a nonfunctional SERCA2 enzyme or cause no SERCA2 to be produced from one copy of the gene.  Cells with only one functional copy of the ATP2A2 gene produce half the normal amount of SERCA2 protein.  It is thought that insufficient amounts of SERCA2 combined with outside factors such as heat and minor injury cause the signs and symptoms of Darier disease.Cytogenetic Location: 12q24.11, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 12 at position 24.11Molecular Location: base pairs 110,281,227 to 110,351,093 on chromosome 12 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: March 2008Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
