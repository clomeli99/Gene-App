The SLITRK6 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found primarily in the inner ear and the eye.  This protein promotes growth and survival of nerve cells (neurons) in the inner ear that transmit sound (auditory) signals. It also controls (regulates) the growth of the eye after birth. In particular, the SLITRK6 protein influences the length of the eyeball (axial length), which affects whether a person will be nearsighted or farsighted, or will have normal vision. The SLITRK6 protein spans the cell membrane, where it is anchored in the proper position to perform its function.At least three SLITRK6 gene mutations have been identified in people with deafness and myopia syndrome, a disorder that causes both hearing loss and severe nearsightedness (high myopia). The mutations that cause deafness and myopia syndrome result in an abnormally short SLITRK6 protein that is not anchored properly to the cell membrane. As a result, the protein is unable to function normally. Impaired SLITRK6 protein function leads to abnormal nerve development in the inner ear and improperly controlled eyeball growth, resulting in the hearing loss and nearsightedness that occur in deafness and myopia syndrome.Cytogenetic Location: 13q31.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 13 at position 31.1Molecular Location: base pairs 85,792,787 to 85,799,348 on chromosome 13 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: November 2015Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
