The NEB gene provides instructions for making a protein called nebulin.  This protein plays an important role in skeletal muscles, which are muscles used for movement. Within skeletal muscle cells, nebulin is found in structures called sarcomeres.  Sarcomeres are necessary for muscles to tense (contract). Nebulin is one of several proteins that interact to generate the mechanical force needed for muscle contraction.More than 60 mutations in the NEB gene have been found to cause nemaline myopathy. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the nebulin protein or result in the production of an abnormally short protein. Other mutations insert or delete genetic material in the NEB gene. Most NEB gene mutations alter the structure or reduce the production of nebulin. A lack of functional nebulin impairs the muscle cells' ability to contract. Inefficient muscle contraction leads to muscle weakness and the other features of nemaline myopathy.Cytogenetic Location: 2q23.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 2 at position 23.3Molecular Location: base pairs 151,485,334 to 151,734,487 on chromosome 2 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: May 2010Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
