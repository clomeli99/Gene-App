The SRCAP gene provides instructions for making a protein called Snf2-related CREBBP activator protein, or SRCAP. SRCAP is one of several proteins that help activate a gene called CREBBP. The protein produced from the CREBBP gene, called CREB binding protein, plays a key role in regulating cell growth and division and is important for normal development.At least five SRCAP gene mutations have been identified in people with Floating-Harbor syndrome, a disorder involving short stature, slowing of the mineralization of the bones (delayed bone age), delayed speech development, and characteristic facial features. The SRCAP gene mutations that cause Floating-Harbor syndrome may result in an altered protein that interferes with normal activation of the CREBBP gene, resulting in problems in development. However, the relationship between SRCAP gene mutations and the specific signs and symptoms of Floating-Harbor syndrome is unknown.Cytogenetic Location: 16p11.2, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 16 at position 11.2Molecular Location: base pairs 30,699,141 to 30,740,129 on chromosome 16 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: December 2012Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
