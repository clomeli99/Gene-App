The EOGT gene provides instructions for making a protein that modifies certain other proteins by transferring a molecule called N-acetylglucosamine to them. This change, called an O-GlcNAc modification, can affect protein stability and regulate several cellular processes, such as signaling in cells and the first step in the production of proteins from genes (transcription). Little is known about the proteins altered by the EOGT protein or what effect the O-GlcNAc modification has on them. Studies suggest that Notch proteins may be modified by EOGT. Notch proteins stimulate signaling pathways important during the development of several tissues throughout the body, including the bones, heart, liver, muscles, and blood cells, among others.At least three mutations in the EOGT gene have been found in individuals with Adams-Oliver syndrome. This condition is characterized by areas of missing skin (aplasia cutis congenita), usually on the scalp, and malformations of the hands and feet. The most common EOGT gene mutation involved in this condition, which is found in the Arab population, leads to an abnormally short protein. The other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the EOGT protein. Research suggests that the EOGT gene mutations reduce or eliminate the protein's ability to transfer N-acetylglucosamine. It is unknown what effect this impairment has on cells or how it leads to the features of Adams-Oliver syndrome.Cytogenetic Location: 3p14.1, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 3 at position 14.1Molecular Location: base pairs 68,975,212 to 69,013,961 on chromosome 3 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: November 2015Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
