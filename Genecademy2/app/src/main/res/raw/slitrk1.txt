The SLITRK1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is a member of the SLITRK family.  Proteins in this family are found in the brain, where they play a role in the growth and development of nerve cells. The SLITRK1 protein may help guide the growth of specialized extensions (axons and dendrites) that allow each nerve cell to communicate with nearby cells.Mutations involving the SLITRK1 gene have been identified in a small number of people with Tourette syndrome. One of these mutations, written as del1264C, deletes a single DNA building block (base pair) from the gene. This mutation leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the SLITRK1 protein. Another mutation changes a single base pair in a region of DNA near the gene. This change probably interferes with production of the SLITRK1 protein. Although the SLITRK1 gene is active in areas of the brain known to be involved in Tourette syndrome, it is unclear how mutations in or near the gene lead to the behavioral features of this condition. Because mutations have been reported in so few people with Tourette syndrome, the association of the SLITRK1 gene with this disorder has not been confirmed.Cytogenetic Location: 13q31.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 13 at position 31.1Molecular Location: base pairs 83,877,205 to 83,882,393 on chromosome 13 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: May 2008Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
