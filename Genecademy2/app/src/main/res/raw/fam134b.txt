The FAM134B gene provides instructions for making a protein important for the survival of sensory and autonomic nerve cells (neurons). Sensory neurons transmit pain, touch, and temperature sensations. Autonomic neurons help control involuntary functions of the body such as heart rate and blood pressure. Within neurons, the FAM134B protein is found in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which is important for distribution of proteins to the cell. However, the function of the FAM134B protein is unknown. Studies have shown that neurons in which the FAM134B protein is absent die by a process of self-destruction called apoptosis.Mutations in the FAM134B gene are responsible for one type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) called HSAN2B. People with HSAN2B lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. The FAM134B gene mutations may lead to an abnormally short and nonfunctional protein. The lack of FAM134B protein causes neurons to undergo apoptosis, which reduces the overall number of sensory and autonomic neurons. The loss of neurons results in the signs and symptoms of HSAN2B.Cytogenetic Location: 5p15.1, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 5 at position 15.1Molecular Location: base pairs 16,473,038 to 16,617,058 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: May 2011Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
