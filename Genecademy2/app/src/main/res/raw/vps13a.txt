The VPS13A gene provides instructions for producing a protein called chorein.  Chorein is found in various tissues throughout the body.  The function of this protein is unknown.  Some researchers believe that chorein plays a role in the movement of proteins within cells.Approximately 75 mutations in the VPS13A gene have been found to cause chorea-acanthocytosis.  Most of these mutations insert or delete one or more building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) in the VPS13A gene.  These changes in the gene lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of chorein.  Many of the mutations are specific to single families, although people with chorea-acanthocytosis who are French-Canadian or Japanese tend to have a mutation that is specific to their population.  It is unclear why mutations in the VPS13A gene affect only the brain and red blood cells, causing the signs and symptoms of chorea-acanthocytosis.Cytogenetic Location: 9q21.2, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 9 at position 21.2Molecular Location: base pairs 77,177,353 to 77,421,537 on chromosome 9 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: May 2008Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
