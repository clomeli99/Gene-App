The MASP1 gene provides instructions for making proteins that are involved in a series of reactions called the lectin complement pathway. This pathway is thought to help direct the movement (migration) of cells during early development before birth to form the organs and systems of the body. It appears to be particularly important in directing the migration of neural crest cells, which give rise to various tissues including many tissues in the face and skull, the glands that produce hormones (endocrine glands), and portions of the nervous system. After birth, the lectin complement pathway is involved in the immune system.Three different proteins, MASP-1, MASP-3, and MAp44 can be produced from the MASP1 gene, depending on how the gene's instructions are pieced together.At least 10 MASP1 gene mutations have been identified in people with 3MC syndrome, a disorder characterized by unusual facial features and a variety of problems affecting other tissues and organs of the body. The MASP1 gene mutations that cause 3MC syndrome affect the MASP-3 protein; some affect the MASP-1 protein in addition to MASP-3. The protein changes result in faulty control of cell migration in embryonic development, leading to the various abnormalities that occur in this disorder. Researchers suggest that the existence of parallel pathways in the immune system that can compensate for problems in the lectin complement pathway account for the absence of immune system problems in 3MC syndrome.Cytogenetic Location: 3q27.3, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 3 at position 27.3Molecular Location: base pairs 187,216,085 to 187,292,220 on chromosome 3 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: December 2015Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
