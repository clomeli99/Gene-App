The LETM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not well understood. This protein is active in mitochondria, which are structures within cells that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. The LETM1 protein may be involved in the transport of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across membranes within mitochondria. Researchers suspect that the protein also plays a role in determining the shape and volume of mitochondria.The LETM1 gene is located in a region of chromosome 4 that is deleted in people with the typical features of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome. As a result of this deletion, affected individuals are missing one copy of the LETM1 gene in each cell.  Studies suggest that a loss of this gene alters the structure of mitochondria; however, it is unclear how this abnormality is related to the signs and symptoms of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome.  Specifically, a loss of the LETM1 gene has been associated with seizures or other abnormal electrical activity in the brain.Cytogenetic Location: 4p16.3, which is the short (p) arm of chromosome 4 at position 16.3Molecular Location: base pairs 1,811,479 to 1,856,247 on chromosome 4 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: January 2009Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
