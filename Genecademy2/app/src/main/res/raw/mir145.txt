The MIR145 gene provides instructions for making microRNA-145 (miR-145). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short lengths of RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. These molecules control gene expression by blocking the process of protein production. MiR-145 is abundant in immature blood cells and controls the expression of hundreds of genes. This microRNA is thought to be involved in normal blood cell development. In particular, miR-145 appears to play a role in the growth and division of blood cells called megakaryocytes, which produce platelets, the cell fragments involved in blood clotting.The MIR145 gene is involved in a condition called 5q minus (5q-) syndrome. This condition is a type of bone marrow disorder called myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), in which immature blood cells fail to develop normally. Individuals with 5q- syndrome often have a shortage of red blood cells (anemia) and abnormalities in megakaryocytes. Affected individuals also have an increased risk of developing a fast-growing blood cancer known as acute myeloid leukemia (AML).5q- syndrome is caused by deletion of a region of DNA from the long (q) arm of chromosome 5. This deletion occurs in immature blood cells during a person's lifetime and affects one copy of chromosome 5 in each cell. Most people with 5q- syndrome are missing a sequence of about 1.5 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 1.5 megabases (Mb). This deleted region contains 40 genes, including MIR145. Loss of one copy of the MIR145 gene reduces the amount of the microRNA miR-145 in cells. As a result, levels of proteins whose production is normally blocked by miR-145 are elevated, which leads to the abnormal development of megakaryocytes that occurs in 5q- syndrome. Research suggests that the other features of the condition are associated with other genes in the deleted segment of DNA.Cytogenetic Location: 5q32, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 32Molecular Location: base pairs 149,430,646 to 149,430,733 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: November 2015Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
