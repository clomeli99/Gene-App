The SPG11 gene provides instructions for making the protein spatacsin.  Spatacsin is active (expressed) throughout the nervous system, although its exact function is unknown.  Researchers speculate that it may help control the activity of particular genes (gene expression) or play a role in the transport (trafficking) of proteins.  Spatacsin may also be involved in the maintenance of axons, which are specialized extensions of nerve cells (neurons) that transmit impulses throughout the nervous system.Genetics Home Reference provides information about amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.More than 65 mutations in the SPG11 gene have been found to cause spastic paraplegia type 11.  Most of these mutations change the structure of the spatacsin protein.  The effect that the altered spatacsin protein has on the nervous system is not known.  Researchers suggest that mutations in spatacsin may cause the signs and symptoms of spastic paraplegia type 11 by interfering with the protein's proposed role in the maintenance of axons.Cytogenetic Location: 15q21.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 15 at position 21.1Molecular Location: base pairs 44,562,696 to 44,663,678 on chromosome 15 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: August 2012Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
