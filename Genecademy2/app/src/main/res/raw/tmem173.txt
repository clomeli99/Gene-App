The TMEM173 gene provides instructions for making a protein called STING, which is involved in immune system function. STING helps produce beta-interferon, a member of a class of proteins called cytokines that promote inflammation. Inflammation normally occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and help with tissue repair.At least three TMEM173 gene mutations have been identified in individuals with STING-associated vasculopathy with onset in infancy (SAVI), a potentially life-threatening disorder that damages the skin, lungs, blood vessels, and other tissues. The mutations that cause SAVI are described as "gain-of-function" mutations because they enhance the activity of the STING protein, leading to overproduction of beta-interferon. Abnormally high beta-interferon levels cause excessive inflammation, resulting in damage to the body's own cells and tissues and leading to the signs and symptoms of SAVI. Disorders such as SAVI that result from abnormally increased inflammation are known as autoinflammatory diseases.Cytogenetic Location: 5q31.2, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 5 at position 31.2Molecular Location: base pairs 139,475,528 to 139,482,790 on chromosome 5 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: October 2014Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
