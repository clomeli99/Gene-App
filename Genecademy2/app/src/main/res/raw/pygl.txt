The PYGL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called liver glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme breaks down a complex sugar called glycogen. Liver glycogen phosphorylase is one of three related enzymes that break down glycogen in cells; the other glycogen phosphorylases are found in the brain and in muscles. Liver glycogen phosphorylase is found only in liver cells, where it breaks down glycogen into a type of sugar called glucose-1-phosphate. Additional steps convert glucose-1-phosphate into glucose, a simple sugar that is the main energy source for most cells in the body.At least 17 mutations in the PYGL gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type VI (GSDVI). Most mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in liver glycogen phosphorylase, affecting the normal function of the enzyme. In the Old Order Mennonite population, a common mutation (written as 1620+1GA) disrupts the way the PYGL gene's instructions are used to make the enzyme. A defective liver glycogen phosphorylase enzyme impairs the normal breakdown of glycogen. As a result, liver cells cannot use glycogen for energy, so liver function becomes impaired. A lack of glycogen breakdown within liver cells leads to the major features of GSDVI.Cytogenetic Location: 14q22.1, which is the long (q) arm of chromosome 14 at position 22.1Molecular Location: base pairs 50,905,217 to 50,944,530 on chromosome 14 (Homo sapiens Annotation Release 108, GRCh38.p7) (NCBI)Reviewed: September 2010Published: February 14, 2017The resources on this site should not be used as a substitute for professional medical care or advice.
